State the four main function of a computer?Ans: There are four functions in a fundamental level in computer•	Input: input is the transformation source of information into the system. (e.g. keyboard.) •	Output: the presentation of information to the user. (e.g. screen.)•	Processing: processing is manipulating information into a new form. (e.g. results from a search engine.)•	Store: store is the preservation of information for later use. (e.g. file stored on a hard drive.)2.	Given that the binary sequences below are IAS number words, convert them to their decimal representationMultiplying each of the digits with weight and after add them. The numbers are stored in 8 bytes. a.	1000000000000000000000000000000001001001  Ans: Decimal representing =274877907017b.	0000000000000000000000000000000110010011 Ans: Decimal representing = 403c.	0000000000000000000000000010001101000101 Ans: Decimal representing =9029d.	1000000000000000000000000001100001000111  Ans: Decimal representing = 2748779131593.	#include <iostream>#include <string>  using namespace std;  unsigned int binary_to_decimal(string s) {     if (s.length() > 32)         return 0;     unsigned int value = 0;     for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {         value *= 2;         value += s[i] - '0';     }     return value; }  int main() {     strings;     cout << "Enter a binary string: ";     cin >> s;     cout << s << " in decimal is " << binary_to_decimal(s) << endl;     return 0; }
